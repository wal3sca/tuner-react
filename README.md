#### Nav Bar

At the top of your app you should have a navigation bar.

- It displays a links to the route (`/songs`) at the top of the page.

Your app should also include the following routes:

<hr />

### `/songs`

- Displays a list of `song.title`, `song.is_favorite`, `song.artist` and `song.time` that are clickable to take the user to **`/songs/:id`** IMPORTANT - be sure it goes to the song's `id` **NOT** the array position. Since we are now using a database you should use the `id`.
- Has a button that takes users to the `/songs/new` view
